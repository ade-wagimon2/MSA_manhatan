Creating a Manhattan plot from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of enzyme sequences involves several steps. Here's a general outline to guide you through the process:

1. **Perform Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)**:
   - Use tools like Clustal Omega, MUSCLE, or MAFFT to align your enzyme sequences. This step arranges the sequences to identify regions of similarity.

2. **Calculate Pairwise Distances**:
   - Compute the pairwise distances between sequences in the MSA. This can be done using various metrics like the number of mismatches or more sophisticated methods like the Jukes-Cantor distance.

3. **Identify Significant Variants**:
   - Identify positions in the alignment that show significant variation. This could involve statistical tests to find positions with high variability or specific mutations of interest.

4. **Prepare Data for Plotting**:
   - For each position in the alignment, calculate a statistic that represents its significance (e.g., p-value). This will be plotted on the y-axis of the Manhattan plot, with the position in the alignment on the x-axis.

5. **Generate the Manhattan Plot**:
   - Use a plotting tool or software like R or Python to create the Manhattan plot. In R, you can use the `qqman` package, which is specifically designed for this purpose.

Here's a simple example of how you might generate a Manhattan plot in R:

```r
# Install and load the qqman package
install.packages("qqman")
library(qqman)

# Example data
data <- data.frame(
  CHR = rep(1, 100),  # Chromosome number (can be arbitrary for MSA)
  BP = 1:100,         # Base pair position (alignment position)
  P = runif(100)      # P-values (or other significance measure)
)

# Generate the Manhattan plot
manhattan(data, chr="CHR", bp="BP", p="P", main="Manhattan Plot of MSA")
```

This code creates a basic Manhattan plot using random data. You'll need to replace the example data with your actual MSA data and calculated significance values.
